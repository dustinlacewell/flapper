## Example

A `project_series` asset type is derived from the `project_post` asset type.

Assuming you have `project` and `project_post` asset types, and that `project_post` assets have `.project_name` and `.series_name` fields:

```javascript
{
  'project_series': [
    DeriveSimpleAggregate(
      'project_post',   // target asset type
      'series',         // target asset field
      [                 // value fields
        'project_name',
        'series_name'
      ]
    ),
  ],
}
```

`project_series` assets will be created for each group of `project_post` assets that have the same `.project_name` and `.series_name` fields.
