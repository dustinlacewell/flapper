# How does Flapper work?

Flapper works by following a **plan** to build your site.

**Major concepts**:

-   **Assets**: Bags of metadata
-   **Asset Types**: A group of assets
-   **Proccesor**: Functions which create or update assets
-   **Pipeline**: A list of processors run in sequence
-   **Stage**: A group of pipelines run in sequence

Your job is to:

-   Define some asset types
-   Populate them with assets using processor pipelines
-   Map asset types to URLs and Templates

<Code language="javascript">
    {`const plan = {
    'stage-1': {
        'asset-type-a': [
            // processors
        ],
        'asset-type-b': [
            // processors
        ],
    },
    'stage-2': {
        'asset-type-a': [
            // processors
        ],
        'asset-type-c': [
            // processors
        ],
    },
}`}
</Code>

Flapper then follows this plan to generate your static site.

## Assets and Asset Types

Plain ol javascript objects, that act as bags of metadata.

Assets represent the individual items within some group of similar assets called an "asset type". These could represent pages of your site, posts of a blog, but also software projects, your favorite movies, and whatever else.

What assets you need really comes down to what you want to display on your site.

## Processors

Plain ol javascript functions, that create or modify assets.

Want to source data from a JSON file? Need to convert a title into a slug? Need to associate an asset with another? Whatever processing of asset data you need to do, you do it within processor functions.

## Pipelines and Stages

Pipelines and stages allow you to organize and order your plan.

Each pipeline names an asset type, and any number of processor functions.

Each stage contains any number of pipelines.

Flapper will execute each stage and the pipelines within it, in the order they are defined.

An asset type may appear in multiple pipelines. There's no need to do all the processing of a given asset type in a single pipeline.

## Gatsby Integration

Flapper implements the <Link to="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/#createPages">createPages</Link> Gatsby API. This means that, during Gatsby's build process, when it is ready to render out pages, that is when Flapper jumps into action.

Flapper runs your build plan and at some point you should use the `RenderTemplate` processor to turn your Assets into static HTML pages. Internally, `RenderTemplate` uses the Gatsby <Link to="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/actions/#createPage">createPage</Link> method.
