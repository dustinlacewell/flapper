# Processors

The processors added to your asset pipelines are simple functions that:

-   Create new assets in the asset type
-   Modify assets in the asset type

Each processor is an async function:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`async function MyProcessor(context, type, assets) {
    // add to assets
    // OR
    // modify the assets
}`}
</Code>

## Processor Parameters

Processors receive three parameters:

-   `context`: The current global site context
-   `type`: The name of the current asset type
-   `assets`: The array of assets associated with the asset type

## Types of Processors

All processors work the same way, but they have different uses.

-   Processors like `SourceFilesRecursively`/`SourceMatchedFiles` populate an asset type with assets based on files on disk.
-   Processors like `SetTitle`/`SetUrl` modify existing assets with additional metadata.
-   Processors like `RenderTemplate` write static HTML files for each asset.

Other Processors are even more fancy like the `DeriveAggregateType` asset which produces assets based on the assets of another type.

You can easily write a Processor function to do whatever you need, and use it within your pipelines.

## Processor Factories

Most built-in processors are actually functions which return a processor function.

This allows you to configure the processor from your plan:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`function MyProcessor(option) {
    return async (context, type, assets) => {
        // use option
    }
}`}
</Code>
<Code language="javascript">
    {`'my-asset-type': [
    MyProcessor(true),
]`}
</Code>

## Anonymous Processors

You can of course also write anonymous processors in your plan:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`'my-asset-type': [
    (context, type, assets) => { /* do stuff here */ },
]`}
</Code>
