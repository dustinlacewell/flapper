# Assets

Every Stage in your build plan is composed of one or more Asset Type pipelines:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`const plan = {
    'my-stage': {
        'my-asset-type': [
            // processors
        ],
    },
}`}
</Code>

The Asset Type is just a named collection of Assets, produced by the Processors.

Each Asset is a javascript object with whatever metadata is helpful:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`{
    id: "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    target: "pages/index.html",
    sidebar_items: [
        ['link1', 'https://example.com/'],
        ['link2', 'https://example2.com/'],
    ],
}`}
</Code>

Within your templates, you'll be able to access your Asset Types and Assets:

<Code language="typescript">
    {`
<div>
    {asset.sidebar_items.map(([label, url]) =>
        <a href={url}>{label}</a>
    )}
</div>
`}
</Code>

## URL Targetting

An asset's `.target` property is special.

It is utilized by processors like `RenderTemplate` to know where an asset should be rendered to. Additionally, it is used by your templates/components to provide links to assets.

The `.target` property should be set for any assets that will be involved in template rendering, before rendering happens.

The `.target` property can be set using the `SetUrl` processor or any other method.
