# Plan Structure

The object passed to the Flapper plugin's `plan` option has a specific structure:

<Code language="javascript">
    {`const plan = {
    'stage-1': {
        'asset-type-a': [
            // processors
        ],
        'asset-type-b': [
            // processors
        ],
    },
    'stage-2': {
        'asset-type-a': [
            // processors
        ],
        'asset-type-c': [
            // processors
        ],
    },
}`}
</Code>

Every top-level property in the Plan is the name of a Stage.

Every top-level property of a Stage is the name of an Asset Type.

The plan is executed in the order in which the Stages and Asset Type pipelines are defined.
